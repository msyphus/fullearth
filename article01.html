                “That’s insane!” I thought as I sat in Norway listening to a Brazilian researcher presenting on a possible way to utilize human food waste to grow more food.  He said that one third of all food produced is wasted.  “Where did he get that number,” I thought. “That’s crazy!”
            </p>
            <p>
                I couldn’t resist, I had to talk with him after his presentation.  He told me that was the official global statistic from the United Nations.  I had to see that for myself!
            </p>
            <p>
                Sure enough: <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/mb060e/mb060e00.htm" target="_blank">FAO. 2011. Global food losses and food waste – Extent, causes and prevention. Rome</a>. 
                There's the primary source, which states, “Roughly one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a scientist, I was intrigued by the research project I saw presented.  As a process engineer, specifically certified in Lean Six Sigma, I couldn’t get my mind off of all that waste.  We always talk about how we need to increase world food production, but what would happen if we just eliminated all that waste first?
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to dig into the numbers and determine how much food a person needs then calculate how many people current food production can provide for and how many people could be taken care of if we just stopped wasting one third of all we produce.  As I was digging for those numbers, I discovered that the UN already did that.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If we could reduce food waste and loss by roughly just 25 per cent, we would have additional food for about 500 million people a year.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Producing enough food to feed the world does not guarantee food security. Hunger exists today although there is enough food for all. Even if we increase agricultural output in 60 per cent by 2050, we will still have 300 million people going hungry due to lack of proper access to food. Access is central to hunger.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Those quotes are directly from the Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, José Graziano Da Silva, in his UN Chronicle article, <a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/feeding-world-sustainably" target="_blank">“Feeding the World Sustainably.”</a>  
            </p>
            <p>
                One point of context here is that the mention of increasing agricultural output 60% by 2050 is referring to the current estimate of what we have to do in order to feed the world in 2050.  But did you notice what he said?  We are already producing enough food…even with one third of it being wasted!  The problem isn’t food production, it’s food distribution!  What a powerful example illustrating the philosophy behind this site.  The earth is full, it is producing enough, we just need to learn how to use it!
            </p>
            <p>
                So what would happen if we cut our waste?  As stated, cutting our waste by 25% would free up food for an additional 500 million people.  According to the <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/ga12294.doc.htm" target="_blank">General Assembly meeting</a> of the UN in December 2020, there are 135 million people “marching towards starvation” and the COVID-19 pandemic is creating another 135 million people in that march, for a total of 270 million people.  So if we cut our waste by 25%, we’d be able to end starvation and still have food left over!
            </p>
            <p>
                Starvation isn’t the only issue, though.  The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/food/#:~:text=The%20latest%20available%20estimates%20indicate,AIDS%2C%20malaria%20and%20tuberculosis%20combined" target="_blank">UN states</a> that 821 million people worldwide are undernourished. So with our 25% waste reduction, we’d be able to take care of the 270 million “marching towards starvation” and take care of 230 million undernourished people.  Now here’s where I wish I had access to raw data, because I assume (but don’t know) that the 270 million “marching towards starvation” are part of the 821 million undernourished people.  If that were the case, we’d be able to take care of most undernourished people (61%) if we just cut our food waste by 25%.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, what if we cut our food waste by 50%?  We’d be freeing up food for 1 Billion people!  And if we entirely cut all our food waste, we’d be able to feed another 2 Billion people.  That would be more than enough to cover the projected world population growth of 1.5 Billion people by 2050 (2050 projected population = <a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/feeding-world-sustainably" target="_blank">9.3 Billion</a>, current population = <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/" target="_blank">7.8 Billion</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                The number 2 Billion also shows up today.  That’s how many people don’t have access to regular <a href="https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/food/#:~:text=The%20latest%20available%20estimates%20indicate,AIDS%2C%20malaria%20and%20tuberculosis%20combined" target="_blank">“safe, nutritious, and sufficient food.” </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine if we could get food that already exists and just goes to waste into the hands of the 2 Billion people who don’t have regular access to it!  Imagine ending hunger today because we stopped wasting food!
